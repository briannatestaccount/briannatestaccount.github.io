                            BlueSky Research is for those who question but are never satisfied with the first answer they find. It's for those who believe in science, but understand that life is the most important laboratory. It's for those that know a good theory is highly practical, but only when it's applied. <br> <br> BlueSky exists for those operating at the intersection of Truth and application to answer questions about the human experience, both through scientific inquiry and the translation of those findings into universal tools and frameworks.

                            Two millennia ago men like Aristotle and Pythagoras set out to answer questions about the nature of the world around them - social, spiritual, and physical.  This call was echoed through the renaissance, through the enlightenment, and through the modern era - that science would give us answers to life's most pressing questions. <br> <br> Yet today we find our universities - what were supposed to be society's main engines in the pursuit of new knowledge - mired in politics, departmental power struggles, and a tenure system that incentivizes all the wrong things. <br> <br> Where is the search for Truth?  Where is the thirst for answers?  Where is the focus on using knowledge to make society a better place? <br> <br> The BlueSky Research Institute was founded by a group of academics and practitioners who believed there was a better way to achieve the ideals which academia aspired but failed to achieve.  Guided by a simple credo, they have decided to take up the call.

                            BlueSky is reimagining the way the social sciences creates and spreads knowledge in three ways: <br> <br> Practical Focus: Our research is practical. We pick problems people care about, work to understand the mechanisms at play, then build and test practical models that people can actually use. Research is multidisciplinary and supported by both the laboratory and real life. <br> <br> True Dialectic: At BlueSky, ideas come from a process not a person. When the team owns a process instead of an individual owning an idea, it allows for stronger challenges and more rigorous debate, leading to a better end product. <br> <br> Accessible Materials: Relevance, rigor, and practicality are necessary, but not sufficient. To make a difference, the research must get in front of the right people in a format that speaks to them. Through the use of digital media, BlueSky is changing the way people discover research, targeting the people who need it when they need it, and allowing researchers and practitioners to interact with the findings, which in turn serves as the basis for further research.
